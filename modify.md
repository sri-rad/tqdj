To add or change the music in tqdj, there are a few steps you have to take.

  

####  Requirements

- The files must be in .wav format.

  

####  Steps

1. First, you need to figure out what song you would like to add, and then find a .wav formatted file that has that song on it.

2. Next, put that file into the folder /tqdj/music.

3. Once the file is in the /music folder, go back up to the /tqdj folder and open up player.py.
4. From there, copy this code into the self.audio_files list under the definition \_\_init\_\_, make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual filename and song title.

```python

{

'path': os.path.join(dir_path,  'SONG.wav'),

'name':  'SONG - ARTIST'

}

```

Don't forget to add a comma after the previous song! (Cruisin' Along)

5. Once this is done, save and  quit,  and your custom songs should be added!
